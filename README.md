DESCRIPTION:
Finance companies have gathered a lot of credit-related information and basic bank details over the years. Finance companies would like to develop intelligent systems to categorize customers into credit score brackets to reduce manual work. These credit score ranges are useful for calculating the risk of lending and determining the interest rate on a loan.

 Objective: Create a machine learning model to predict each customer's credit score brackets as good, average, or poor
